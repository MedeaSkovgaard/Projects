# Professional Data Analysis & Bioinformatics Portfolio

This repository contains selected projects designed to demonstrate my analytical workflow, coding style, and methodological approach using publicly available datasets. The focus is on clear problem formulation, reproducible analysis, and well-documented reasoning, reflecting how I approach real-world data problems in practice.

The project scopes are intentionally bounded to highlight end-to-end analytical thinking, appropriate tool selection, and clean, maintainable code rather than dataset size or problem scale. Across projects, emphasis is placed on transparency, interpretability, and methodological correctness.


## Projects
### Data Analysis with Python

A complete data analysis workflow implemented in JupyterLab, including data exploration, cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization, with a short SQL excursion for data querying and integration.

**Tools & Technologies:**

- Python

- NumPy, Pandas, SciPy

- Matplotlib, Seaborn

- SQLite3

- JupyterLab

### Personalized Nutrition — Tailoring Dietary Recommendations to an Individual’s Health Status

A data-driven project focusing on SQL-based data handling and Bash scripting, illustrating how structured health-related data can be queried, transformed, and processed to support individualized nutritional insights.

**Tools & Technologies:**

- SQL

- Bash

### Statistics and Data Visualization Using R

Demonstrates statistical analysis and data visualization using R, with an emphasis on exploratory data analysis, statistical reasoning, and clear graphical communication.

**Tools & Technologies:**

- R

- RStudio

## Guiding Principles Across Projects
